## Segreg  - A QGIS plugin for segregation measures calculation

**Segreg** is part of Resolution project (REsilient Systems fOr Land Use TransportatION):
 https://www.researchgate.net/project/RESOLUTION-REsilient-Systems-fOr-Land-Use-TransportatION-2

**Project Goal**: In a context of rapid urban growth, cities across the world are increasingly defined by inequality. RESOLUTION, a collaborative project between Brazilian and British academics, explores the impacts of unequal access to transport on different social groups in London and São Paulo. To this end, the team will build agent based models of how populations compete for travel and location.

### The plugin
The plugin allows to compute segregation and diversity measures on spatial and non spatial modes. The following measures are supported:
* Population Intensity
* Local Dissimilarity
* Local Expousure/Isolation
* Local Entropy
* Local Index H
* Global Dissimilarity
* Global Expousure/Isolation
* Global Entropy
* Global Index H

### Requirements
Segreg is an experimental plugin, so it is required to check the flag `Show also experimental plugins` under QGIS plugin settings.
- QGIS vesion 2.18.2 or later
- Scipy module
