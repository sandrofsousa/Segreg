# Segreg  - A QGIS plugin for segregation measures calculation
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/59612821.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/59612821)

**Segreg** is part of Resolution project (REsilient Systems fOr Land Use TransportatION):
 https://www.researchgate.net/project/RESOLUTION-REsilient-Systems-fOr-Land-Use-TransportatION-2

**Project Goal**: In a context of rapid urban growth, cities across the world are increasingly defined by inequality. RESOLUTION, a collaborative project between Brazilian and British academics, explores the impacts of unequal access to transport on different social groups in London and SÃ£o Paulo. To this end, the team will build agent based models of how populations compete for travel and location.

## The plugin
The plugin allows to compute segregation and diversity measures on spatial and non spatial modes. The following measures are supported:
* Population Intensity
* Local Dissimilarity
* Local Exposure/Isolation
* Local Entropy
* Local Index H
* Global Dissimilarity
* Global Exposure/Isolation
* Global Entropy
* Global Index H

## Requirements
Segreg is an experimental plugin, so it is required to check the flag `Show also experimental plugins` under QGIS plugin settings.
- QGIS version 2.0 or later
- Scipy module
